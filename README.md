# Cell Simulator

This cell-sim is designed to mimic a LiPo battery pack for develpoment of the surrounding electronics, like a BMS.

- 16 channels
- Open-Source hardware design, you can embed onto your own HIL setup
- ⚡️ 0-5V and 0-500mA per channel
- DMM muxed to each channel for arbitarily precise measurment
- Open-circuit simulation on each channel
- 📏 16bit ADC feedback for voltage and current
- 🔌 USB + 100MBit Ethernet + WiFi w/ Python software interface
